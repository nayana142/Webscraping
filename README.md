# Webscraping
Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves using a program or script to access a web page, retrieve its HTML content, and then parse and extract specific information from that content.

## Process:
    1. Identify the Target Website:Determine the website from which you want to scrape data.
    2. Choose a Scraping Tool or Library:  Python: BeautifulSoup, Requests, Scrapy
    3. Access the Web Page: Use the chosen tool or library to send an HTTP request to the target web page and retrieve its HTML content. This can be done with 
       libraries like Requests in Python
    4.Parse the HTML: Once you have the HTML content, you need to parse it to extract the specific data you're interested in. This is where libraries like 
      BeautifulSoup in Python  come in handy
    5.Extract Data: Use the parsing library to locate and extract the desired data elements from the HTML. This may involve selecting elements by their HTML tags, 
      attributes, or other patterns. You can extract text, links, images, or any other content as needed.
    6.Store or Process Data: Depending on your project's requirements, you can either store the scraped data in a database, write it to a file, or process it further 
      for analysis
